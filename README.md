# Encryption

This is a self contained Pyhton program. The user does not need to install anything and does not need python or an IDE on their local host

The exe file will generate the keys when first run and will link them to the appropriate files
The pop up window will allow the end user to encrypt and decrypt passwords without seeing behind the curtain

The program can be run manually by opening the files inside of an IDE.
